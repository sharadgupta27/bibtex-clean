# Clean BibTeX File

This script cleans a BibTeX file by removing unnecessary fields. This is particularly useful for cleaning up `.bib` files generated by reference managers such as Mendeley.

## Dependencies

The script uses `tkinter` for the file dialogs. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install tk
```

## Usage

1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python bibtex-clean.py
   ```
2. A file dialog will open. Select the `.bib` file you want to clean.
3. Another file dialog will open. Choose a location and name for the cleaned `.bib` file.

## Example

### Input (`sample.bib`)

```bibtex

abstract = {Estimates of global forest area vary widely; this discrepancy is now shown to originate primarily from ambiguity in the definition of ‘forest'. Monitoring and reporting should focus on measures more directly relevant to ecosystem function. Deforestation is a major driver of climate change1 and the major driver of biodiversity loss1,2. Yet the essential baseline for monitoring forest cover—the global area of forests—remains uncertain despite rapid technological advances and international consensus on conserving target extents of ecosystems3. Previous satellite-based estimates4,5 of global forest area range from 32.1 × 106 km2 to 41.4 × 106 km2. Here, we show that the major reason underlying this discrepancy is ambiguity in the term ‘forest'. Each of the >800 official definitions6 that are capable of satellite measurement relies on a criterion of percentage tree cover. This criterion may range from >10% to >30% cover under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change7. Applying the range to the first global, high-resolution map of percentage tree cover8 reveals a discrepancy of 19.3 × 106 km2, some 13% of Earth's land area. The discrepancy within the tropics alone involves a difference of 45.2 Gt C of biomass, valued at US$1 trillion. To more effectively link science and policy to ecosystems, we must now refine forest monitoring, reporting and verification to focus on ecological measurements that are more directly relevant to ecosystem function, to biomass and carbon, and to climate and biodiversity.},
